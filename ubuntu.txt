		OS module : 	(outdated no longer used)
				os.system() : used to execute shell calls but output is printed on terminal.
				os.popen() : it's same as system call but returns a new file object and redirects output to it.
				Eg: a=os.popen("git status -s")
				    print a.read()

		SUBPROCESS module : (latest , forks the process and can be used to alter the input and output pipes)
				subprocess.call() : used to execute shell by forking parent process and return output to terminal.
				subprocess.check_output() : used to return the output to a variable .
				Eg : abc = subprocess.check_output('ls -l',shell=True)
